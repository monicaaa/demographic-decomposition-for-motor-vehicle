## What are the differences in motor vehicle death rates between black and white population groups? 

Looking at all MV deaths

```{r mv all}
plot_exposure(exp.all)
bw_percent_diff_all %>% kable()
```

```{r mv pveh}
plot_exposure(exp.pveh)
bw_percent_diff_pveh %>% kable()
```

```{r mv ped}
plot_exposure(exp.ped)
bw_percent_diff_ped %>% kable()
```

## To what extent does amount of travel account for these differences? 

exposure
risk

decomp
```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
risk_exp_plot
```
